# Heart Disease Prediction Using ML 

# Overview
This project leverages  machine learning techniques to predict the risk of heart disease. Utilizing scikit-learn for model building and pandas for data manipulation, we ensure high accuracy and reliability. MLflow is employed for experiment tracking and model management, while Optuna is used for hyperparameter optimization. The project includes an interactive user interface built with Streamlit, providing real-time predictions and visualizations.

# Features
- Data Preprocessing: Efficiently handle and clean data using pandas.

- Model Building: Construct robust models with scikit-learn.

- Hyperparameter Optimization: Optimize model performance using Optuna.

- Experiment Tracking: Track experiments and model metrics with MLflow.

- User Interface: Build interactive UI with Streamlit for real-time predictions and visualizations.

# Installation
 - Clone the repository and install the necessary packages:

bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
- Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the data.

- Training: Train the model with optimized hyperparameters.

- Inference: Use the trained model to make predictions.

- Visualization: Use the Streamlit interface for real-time visualizations.
